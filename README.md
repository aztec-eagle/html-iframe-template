# IFrame Template for Clickjacking Demonstration

This is a simple HTML template that demonstrates the use of an iframe to embed an external webpage within another webpage. The example can be used to showcase or test for clickjacking vulnerabilities, which occur when an external site is embedded within an iframe, potentially leading to unauthorized interaction with the embedded site.

## Overview

The template contains an HTML file that embeds a webpage within an iframe element. The purpose of this template is to demonstrate how an external website can be framed, potentially leading to security issues like clickjacking. Clickjacking occurs when a user interacts with a website that they do not see or understand, as it has been disguised or "framed" within another webpage.

### Features:
- IFrame border styling (thick red border).
- Customizable height and width of the iframe.
- Title and heading included for context.

## How It Works

1. **Iframe Element**: An iframe is used to embed an external webpage within the main HTML page.
2. **Red Border**: A thick red border is added around the iframe to make it visually distinct, which can be useful for demonstration purposes.
3. **Content**: The iframe currently loads `https://example.com/`, but this URL can be changed to any site you want to embed.
4. **Styling**: The iframe's appearance can be easily modified via CSS for different layouts or testing environments.

## Customization

You can customize the template in several ways:

### 1. Change the Embedded Website

To embed a different website in the iframe, modify the `src` attribute of the `<iframe>` tag. Replace the URL in the code snippet below:

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com/" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
